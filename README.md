## Data Engineering

| Project | Area of Study | Tools | Description |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|---------------------|
| 🏪 [Supermarket Datawarehouse](https://github.com/hengkisan/azure-supermarket-datawarehouse) | Azure, Data Warehouse | Pyspark, Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks | Developed a data warehouse for supermarket sales using Azure Databricks, Data Factory, and Data Lake Gen 2. Databricks with PySpark transforms raw data into target tables by reading from weekly folders. The sales table is partitioned by branch_id and receipt_id for efficient updates. Azure Data Factory orchestrates the pipeline, checking for folder existence and triggering Databricks Notebooks as needed, with a Tumbling Window Trigger scheduling weekly runs. This setup ensures efficient, regular updates and accurate data management.|

## Machine Learning

| 😊 [Facial Expression Recognition](https://github.com/hengkisan/FER-python) | Deep Learning, Image Recognition | Python | Constructed a real-time facial expression recognition (FER) system using the VGG16 convolutional neural network on the FER2013 dataset. VGG16 model was adapted with 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers, incorporating batch normalization and L2 regularization. The final system uses OpenCV for real-time video processing, employing Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and trained model for emotion prediction.|
| 💳 [Bank Attrition](https://github.com/hengkisan/bank-attrition-SAS) | Data Science, Data Analysis | SAS | Investigated customer attrition in the banking sector, focusing on credit card usage patterns. Utilizing SAS Enterprise Miner and a dataset from Kaggle.com, the analysis includes data mining, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling. The study recommends personalized retention strategies based on customer behaviors, such as tailored offers for under-utilized cards and financial counseling for those with excessive spending.|
